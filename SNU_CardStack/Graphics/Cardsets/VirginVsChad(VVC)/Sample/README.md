# Info

This is the image file for a Virgin Vs Chad card set I found on Reddit. [Credit to u/TriangularUnion](https://old.reddit.com/user/TriangularUnion) for the [original image](https://old.reddit.com/r/virginvschad/comments/fxq97d/virgin_vs_chad_playing_card_set_wip/)

**Note:**

_I had to search old.reddit.com to find it, as the option to search within a subreddit seems to have been removed on desktop._

## Implementation

I am currently deciding where these cards will be applicable, I am hoping for most, if not all card games in CardStack.
